# vite-todo
A simple todo app to familiarize with Vue3, ViteJS, Vitesse starting template, Pinia for state management...

Previously, I am proficient in using VueJS 2.0, VueX for state management, Vuetify for design

Indeed, the HMR is barely effective for VueJS 2.0 dev server. It takes minutes every time I change a code and serve the dev server.

This simple app is to get my hands used to the Vue3 environment. A youtube video about "Vue CLI vs Vite" has convinced me to try this simple app.
